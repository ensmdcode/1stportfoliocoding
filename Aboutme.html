                        Hello reader! My name is Emmanuel John Amar Sumido from Grade 9 Fairness studying in Las Pi√±as Science High School. My date of birth is the 22nd of December 2009, which means I am currently 14 years of age. I have a few hobbies which include playing online games. I play many games like Roblox, Geometry Dash, Mobile Legends and Brawl Stars. I would not say that I have a favorite game though. Another thing is that I love coding. Its just so fun (I cannot deny that it's stressful though). Other than that, I also like to solve Rubik's Cubes. I solve either for fun or very seriously. The average time it takes for me to be able to solve one is roughly 14 seconds. <br> <br> 
                        I participated in various competitions involving the subject Mathematics or other competitions outside of school involving Rubik's Cubes. An example solve which was done in a competition is shown in the video on the left. <br> <br>
                        I don't really like socializing if it's with people I'm not comfortable with. If it is with my friends then i can probably spend quite a while talking to them as long as I dont run of ideas. Some of those friends are part of the picture shown on the left. My favorite subjects are definitely Mathematics and ICT, though I like the overall coding side of ICT better.

                        Hey again!!! Not much has changed about me in this quarter. One of the only "new" stuff i have done is that I started to play volleyball! Oh and also, have you noticed that I changed the website a bit? Interesting right? Probably not. Thats another thing if ever you'd count that. <br> <br>
                        I also forgot to mention in the first quarter what my favorite music and color was! My favorite color is green and my favorite music as of me writing this is "Realms" by Hinkik and A Himitsu (it's not a lyrical song) shown on the audio file. Well, not much to show here so see you next time when I learn some new stuff!
