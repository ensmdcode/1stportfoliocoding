                        In the Beginning... This quarter of ICT is pretty fun. We are getting much deeper into coding which makes me interested since I've liked coding for a while now. The performance tasks are very fun too to say the least. There are just some things I dont enjoy that much and those are quizzes. Some terms being asked there are pretty confusing even though they seem easy. I tend to overthink quite a lot so that is a bad habit I need to fix immediately. Other than that i dont really find anything else unenjoyable. <br> <br>
                        As for time-limited hands ons, they are very exciting. They kind of force you to lock in since you have only 45 minutes to finish your output (or even less time than that). All the lessons are also pretty cool though because for example, XHTML taught me something I didn't even know HTML ever had (like the use of an empty tag with a slash in front to represent closing). Lists and tables overall seem pretty simple since its just a few things you need to be familiar with and understand. That is until you get to nested lists which are pretty awkward at first, but once you think about it, it starts to make sense. Hyperlinks are also pretty easy to understand. You just cover up content with the "a" tag and add "href" for the target and you're done. One thing i can say for sure is that I would definitely be able to apply this for my future activities. Most of the stuff discussed in this quarter is a very big foundation for content layout. XHTML for preparation to stricter coding, lists and tables for better layouts, links for navigation, forms for better interaction and a way for data input. <br> <br>
                        Overall I learned quite a lot in this first quarter and I am going to apply the things I learned in the future. This quarter is also really fun for me.

                        The Continuation... Now we get to the fun part, CSS! CSS! CSS! Okay let's get serious for a bit. In quarter 2 we finally started focusing on learning the fundamentals of CSS. While we are learning important attributes of CSS one by one, you might not notice it, but we are also learning about what they're used on, their capabilities, their restrictions and what they actually are. It's like we can't just blindly use the properties just because "Oh, it does that. I guess I'm gonna use it and not know what it actually does.". One of the reasons for this is because we will probably have a hard time adjusting some elements since we know that one property can, for example, adjust the margins. But the thing is, we might not know that it can actually do something else as well, like for example, adjust the position of the text since it is a block element. Basically what I am trying to say is that there are other things besides the property itself you want to study if you want to know what the property is capable of. <br/> <br/>
                        Speaking of capability, CSS gives you quite a LOT of freedom in coding if I must say. If there is one thing I have learned in coding, it's that more freedom can also grant more difficulty. That is why we need to be EXTREMELY careful when coding pretty big projects like this portfolio I am doing right now. I am not saying you shouldn't be careful even in small projects like Hands Ons, but rather just be careful at all times. <br/> <br/>
                        Of course I wouldn't have pulled through this without the help of my classmates and most especially my teacher.

                        In the beginning of the end... This 3rd quarter was the most interesting not just for ICT, but for every subject as well. But for now, let's focus on ICT. In quarter 3 ICT, we learned about the basics of JavaScript, the easy-to-use programming language focused on the behaviour of your website. In the first lesson, it mentions about the characteristics of JavaScript and its basics. The second lesson talks about his history and its associations. The third lesson focuses on the main elements of JavaScript including objects and methods. The fourth lessons talked about variables and the different data types a veriable can have. The fifth lesson focuses on the operators that are mostly used to compare different data types and manipulate them. The last lesson mentions how to ACTUALLY start a javascript code, where to place it, and the different guidelines it has. <br/> <br/>
                        What I have noticed in JavaScript is that it looks complicated early on because of the weird symbols it has like "==", "&&" and even weird terms like if-else conditions and functions. However, if you try to understand what each symbol does and what the terms mean, you can actually understand JavaScript pretty easily. All you need to make sure is that you understand everything carefully, most especially since javascript is <span style="color: #FF0000; font-weight: bold;">case sensitive</span>. When considering the fact that this programming lanuage manipulates capital and small letters very weirdly, we could easily mess up. I'm glad I was able to understand the pattern in JavaScript. Of course with the help of many people. <br/> <br/>

            <div class="Refdiv ref4">

                    <div class="p2">
                        In the end... 4th quarter really tested my limits in many different ways. Also it really is dissapointing that I was not able to attend the ICT classes due to the amount of sessions where I was excused for competition purposes. However I was still able to understand the lessons we were taught. <br/> </br/>
                        The first lesson is focused on the different events and event triggers that are used when we were interacting with different elements in javascript which include clicking, hovering, or even loading. The second lesson is about conditions and controls so we can have a grasp on how we can manipulate a line of code where it only occurs once a specific condition is met, a common example is the if-statement. The third lesson is basically a continuation of the second lesson but it has the additional "switch statement" and a "return" method. The 4th lesson discusses about the different type of loops which will prove useful when we want to know when and how a certain line of code will be repeated. <br/> <br/>
                        Though not too much has changed since 3rd quarter, I still wouldnt ignore the things we learned. The main difference is that this quarter focused on the different conditions we can set to manipulate when and how a code will be done.
