                        In the Beginning... This quarter of ICT is pretty fun. We are getting much deeper into coding which makes me interested since I've liked coding for a while now. The performance tasks are very fun too to say the least. There are just some things I dont enjoy that much and those are quizzes. Some terms being asked there are pretty confusing even though they seem easy. I tend to overthink quite a lot so that is a bad habit I need to fix immediately. Other than that i dont really find anything else unenjoyable. <br> <br>
                        As for time-limited hands ons, they are very exciting. They kind of force you to lock in since you have only 45 minutes to finish your output (or even less time than that). All the lessons are also pretty cool though because for example, XHTML taught me something I didn't even know HTML ever had (like the use of an empty tag with a slash in front to represent closing). Lists and tables overall seem pretty simple since its just a few things you need to be familiar with and understand. That is until you get to nested lists which are pretty awkward at first, but once you think about it, it starts to make sense. Hyperlinks are also pretty easy to understand. You just cover up content with the "a" tag and add "href" for the target and you're done. <br> <br> 
                        One thing i can say for sure is that I would definitely be able to apply this for my future activities. Most of the stuff discussed in this quarter is a very big foundation for content layout. XHTML for preparation to stricter coding, lists and tables for better layouts, links for navigation, forms for better interaction and a way for data input. <br> <br>
                        Overall I learned quite a lot in this first quarter and I am going to apply the things I learned in the future. This quarter is also really fun for me.

                        The Continuation... Now we get to the fun part, CSS! CSS! CSS! Okay let's get serious for a bit. In quarter 2 we finally started focusing on learning the fundamentals of CSS. While we are learning important attributes of CSS one by one, you might not notice it, but we are also learning about what they're used on, their capabilities, their restrictions and what they actually are. It's like we can't just blindly use the properties just because "Oh, it does that. I guess I'm gonna use it and not know what it actually does.". One of the reasons for this is because we will probably have a hard time adjusting some elements since we know that one property can, for example, adjust the margins. But the thing is, we might not know that it can actually do something else as well, like for example, adjust the position of the text since it is a block element. Basically what I am trying to say is that there are other things besides the property itself you want to study if you want to know what the property is capable of. <br/> <br/>
                        Speaking of capability, CSS gives you quite a LOT of freedom in coding if I must say. If there is one thing I have learned in coding, it's that more freedom can also grant more difficulty. That is why we need to be EXTREMELY careful when coding pretty big projects like this portfolio I am doing right now. I am not saying you shouldn't be careful even in small projects like Hands Ons, but rather just be careful at all times. <br/> <br/>
                        Of course I wouldn't have pulled through this without the help of my classmates and most especially my teacher.
